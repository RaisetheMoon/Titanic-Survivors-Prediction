# Titanic-Survivors-Prediction
As my first machine learning project, I chose the classic competition topic on Kaggle - Titanic.

> The RMS Titanic, a luxury steamship, sank in the early hours of April 15, 1912, off the coast of Newfoundland in the North Atlantic after sideswiping an iceberg during its maiden voyage. Of the 2,240 passengers and crew on board, more than 1,500 lost their lives in the disaster.

The movie "Titanic" is also one of my favorite movie, but before I became a data analyst/scientist, I never thought about below questions - 

"What sort of people are most likely survive than others? Can we use machine learning to predict the survival rate and utilize it to other similar events?"

In a word, the goal of this project is to build a machine learning model to predict who survived after the tragedy by using their personal data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).
