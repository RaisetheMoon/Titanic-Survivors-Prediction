# Titanic-Survivors-Prediction
As my first machine learning project, I chose the classic competition topic on Kaggle - Titanic. The Titanic also one of my favorite movie, before I interact with data I never thought about this question - **how many survivors on earth after the tragedy? Can we predict it if we have another similar crash on another boat.**
